Input
On the first line you will receive the length of the first side of the triangle
On the second line you will receive the length of the second side of the triangle
On the third line you will receive the length of the third side of the triangle
Output
Print the surface of the rectangle with two digits of precision
Constraints
Input data describes a valid triangle
